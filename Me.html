      <h1>Hello! I'm Atiana.</h1>

      I could list off my professional skills like adaptability, problem-solving, and tech expertise... but I'd rather start by telling you who I am. I’m the youngest in my family — and the only girl. Growing up surrounded entirely by brothers and male cousins meant I had no choice but to be tough, outspoken, and unapologetically myself. That environment taught me early how to stand out and hold my own, and it’s shaped the way I move through life — with confidence, creativity, and drive.

      I found my love for coding when I realized just how powerful it is to bring ideas to life. There’s something deeply satisfying about solving problems through code — writing a line, running it, tweaking it, and watching it evolve into something real and functional. I’ve built mobile and web-based apps using technologies like Python, Java, Flutter, and HTML/CSS. One of my proudest experiences so far has been developing an anatomy learning app during my internship. It helped me realize how much I enjoy building things that people can actually use — following a blueprint, translating it into clean, functional code, and watching it become something that meets a real need.

      Outside of tech, I’m big on staying active and connected to the things that ground me. You can usually find me at a car event with friends, in the gym lifting, playing soccer, or on a hike with my two Japanese Akitas — Casanova and Yami.

      My dream car? A Honda S2000, hands down. I’ve always been drawn to the car world, not just for the adrenaline, but for the community and the creativity it takes to make something your own. Just like with coding, you start with a framework — then make it personal.

      When it comes to what inspires me, I’m fueled by challenge, creativity, and a good story. Some of my favorite animes are <em>Hunter x Hunter</em> and <em>Naruto</em> — because they’re about growth, resilience, and rising above what people expect of you. One quote I live by is:
      <br><br>
      <strong><em>"Create the things you wish existed."</em></strong>
      <br><br>
      That applies to everything I do — whether I’m building a UI, solving a logic problem, designing a page layout, or just trying to be the kind of person I needed when I was younger. I’m not here to just fit in — I’m here to build, improve, and make something that matters.
