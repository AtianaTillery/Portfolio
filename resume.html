      <h1>Here‚Äôs the Professional Side of Me.</h1>

      <p>
        I‚Äôm Atiana ‚Äî a dual-degree graduate in Management Information Systems and Finance with double minors in Software Development and Operations & Supply Chain. But beyond the credentials, I‚Äôm a natural-born leader who thrives in fast-paced environments and adapts quickly to whatever is thrown my way. Whether I‚Äôm coding an app, managing a project, or supporting clients face-to-face, I bring consistency, confidence, and a mindset focused on growth and results.
      </p>

      <h2>How I Work</h2>
      <p>
        I believe in showing up with intention and leaving everything better than I found it. I don‚Äôt wait to be told what to do ‚Äî I take initiative, ask smart questions, and lead with purpose. My leadership style is hands-on and collaborative. I listen, plan, and execute with precision ‚Äî whether I‚Äôm managing a sprint or tackling a bug in the code. My versatility is one of my strongest assets. I‚Äôve worn many hats in school, work, and life ‚Äî and every role has sharpened my ability to adapt and perform under pressure.
      </p>

      <h2>Current Roles</h2>
      <p>
        As an App Developer for <em>Anatomical CheatSheet</em>, I‚Äôm building a cross-platform educational app that supports life-sized anatomy learning. I‚Äôm developing the app from scratch using Android Studio, Visual Studio Code, Flutter, and Python. I‚Äôve improved performance, helped shape UI/UX direction, and learned how to communicate clearly with both developers and non-technical stakeholders. It's the kind of work that challenges and excites me.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, I work as a front desk assistant at LA Fitness, where I handle everything from clearing up ETF (Early Termination Fee) issues to providing excellent support for members. It‚Äôs a fast-paced, people-centered role that keeps my communication and organizational skills sharp.
      </p>

      <h2>Past Experience</h2>
      <p>
        Before stepping fully into tech, I worked for years in veterinary medicine ‚Äî and those experiences shaped my work ethic and empathy. As a Veterinary Assistant and CSR, I supported veterinarians during surgeries, prepped exam rooms, administered medications, handled medical records, and managed scheduling and inventory. These roles demanded focus, quick decision-making, attention to detail, and the ability to comfort clients and patients in stressful moments. That environment taught me how to be composed under pressure, how to work efficiently in a team, and how to adapt in real time ‚Äî all of which I now bring into every tech project I take on.
